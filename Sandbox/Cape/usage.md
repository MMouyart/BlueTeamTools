Once everything is installed and ready to go, let's start cape.
First make sure you are in /opt/CAPEv2 
Then to start cape ```python3 cuckoo.py``` (that is if you did use pip to install cap)
Or ```sudo -u cape poetry run python3 cuckoo.py``` (if you used poetry to install cape). If any error happend, do so ```sudo -u cape poetry run extra/libvirt_installer.sh```
